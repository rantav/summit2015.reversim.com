But is it really working? Is it really adding value to the product and the team?

Many companies and teams in Israel are shifting to being agile, but so many of them don't realize the full potential of it.
So how do you do it right?
In this practical talk I will share with you what we’ve learnt in the past few years on how to do Scrum right, and how we got more out of it from sprint to sprint - for our customers, teams and products.

We’ll focus on how to have effective ceremonies - how to prepare, how to conduct them, what to do once they’re over, and how to get better for the next time. I’ll also remind you why you’re doing Scrum and Agile or why you should do it, and what are some of the signs that you’re doing it wrong.
By the end of this talk you will know how to make your product more successful, and your customer and team more happy."><meta property="twitter:description" content="So you’re doing Scrum. You have a neat backlog, you have a product owner, heck, you even have a designated Scrum master. Great.
