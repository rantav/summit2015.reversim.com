<meta property="twitter:title" content="Confessions of a Java developer that fell in love with the Groovy language | Reversim Summit 2015"><meta name="description" content="After many years of Java development on various projects as a developer or architect and leading other Java developers, I felt that we can do **better**; we, Java developers, can be more **productive**. We can achieve more with less ceremonies. We can **get things done** with less code.

And then I met **Groovy**. It was not a love at first sight: &quot;Hey, no type declarations? No return statement? No.... &quot;. But then I realized: Under the hood, it is still the same old **JVM**, the syntax is just different.  I can progress at my own pace: Java code is already Groovy code, I can learn feature by feature and then use it at my convenience.

That is what I did. For the first few months my Groovy code was almost a Java code, but as I conquered another feature and another feature I got it: Groovy is not only improved Java, there are many **new concepts** that I was not aware of them before: dynamic language, closures , functional programming, meta programming and much more.

Thanks to Groovy I became a **better developer**. Thanks to Groovy I learnt new concepts and now I am not afraid of any new programming language (I already did my first steps with Scala).
Come and hear my **ode to Groovy**.

In this talk I will share my view on why every Java developer **must** know Groovy. Groovy may not replace Java in your organization, but it will definitely enrich your professional capabilities and make you a better and more productive developer.

And yes, I will talk about recent 'Groovy/Grails funding announcement' that created a lot of buzz recently, you definitely want to hear what I have to say about it!
