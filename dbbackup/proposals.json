{"_id":"AHTpXbMAyewgmguLX","abstract":"A traditional Java profiler consists of two components. One collects profile data from the running application and the other is a visualization user interface to query the data. The profiler capabilities are limited by the data collected but also by the provided reports and functionality. This can be limiting when it comes to complex query of data. In this session we will introduce mjprof. It is an open source textual visualization profiler. It is extremely powerful as it enables you to compose a sequence of simple steps  (monads) such as filters, transformations, group-by  which let you slice and dice the data to pinpoint the problem.

{"_id":"Mjt4umZDgzXr6KgSe","abstract":"This session will highlight the simplicity and ease of developing powerful data analytics using Spark and Clojure.  Spark is a BigData processing tool written in Scala that leverages in memory processing and data locality to speed up map-reduce type jobs, while also exposing a rich set of data operations beyond map and reduce.  The functional programming concepts used for data processing in Spark translate cleanly to Clojure, a modern LISP dialect hosted and freely interoperating with the Java Virtual Machine.  Notably, Clojure supports a style of explorative interactive development at the REPL (Read Evel Print Loop), which, in combination with Sparkling, a Clojure API for Spark, allows complex data analytics to be quickly built up and tested in a piecewise manner.  Once an analytic pipeline has been prototyped at the REPL, the same code can then be compiled and submitted to a Spark cluster, shortening the time needed to develop by allowing code from the prototyping phase to be re-used in production.\n\nIn this session, I will spend the first half of the talk introducing Spark and Clojure to explain how they provide a fast, powerful and simple solution for big data processing.  Then I will conduct a live demo to take us through all the steps from prototyping at the REPL with Spark and Clojure to deploying production analytics onto a Mesos cluster.  All the code for the live demo will be provided in a GitHub Repo to give attendees a framework to get them started with Spark and Clojure.\n\nI will present the session in English.","comments":[],"createdAt":{"$date":"2015-01-26T11:36:17.370Z"},"editing":false,"speaker_ids":["Pv9ApaphhaLYrLcf8"],"status":"maybe next time","tags":["data","Clojure","prototyping"],"title":"From the REPL to the Cluster Using Spark and Clojure","type":"full","votes":{"2TvFAL8EvHpCb9uJN":true,"48NYyTEJzTkms9Qwc":true,"A6hhAm5QGXTyHFMSY":true,"AYsk6uLTj9ouou5nR":true,"E3D5QKPdAoZA4kP87":true,"EBmbqCpLb83ar9tpC":true,"GvFexDAjQ6gWMfood":true,"Jx8S3Xqe5gKNkkFgr":true,"KiCTsHyAde7RwKz3c":true,"L4eH2Bk3iTsWqGxw7":true,"PngSJWam3fbjDEMZ9":true,"QtvMkQwqzbbpYjD5y":true,"SYE49viMLfSSDKEA7":true,"Sfsgau5pS9MFnt9hy":true,"SgCEz96uRKCdpBQFc":true,"SxZaZbLvXRBxxa43K":true,"TYN7tuQBSDkJ676dj":true,"YLprpX38TajD5C533":true,"bQx9G2KcFqbkF9fqE":true,"cbsKkZsZu3rmpkP92":true,"eD2bnKFmQ7KXaiAE2":true,"egLMkZQuoLdWN2GLX":true,"jZNaKhWhFyKJcxkXt":true,"k4BDubqG893JTNG3T":true,"nYKnHzwgoAKcApCck":true,"oMxFRJh6AWae4tz9j":true,"oaw7JYHdK7uTNbdKn":true,"pqxRF6NRTjaKX43Q3":true,"ps2wc634WLfhnxzqh":true,"qRssaEGsDgcCBiySo":true,"qpfsYsyGorYtMdvYd":true,"r86AYfHG5nKYSswER":true,"tf8Jemy3FDdfWzvtj":true,"ttYQXSzcNYT64WcKu":true,"vy6LDJTvgX25KMMLE":true,"yNSEkkZXdhELzdEEN":true}}

{"_id":"NDsYuaLPikvERLq43","abstract":"Today computers aren't very good at understanding human language, and that forces people to do a lot of the heavy lifting—for example, speaking \"searchese\" to find information online.\n\nWhile state-of-the-art technology is still a ways from this goal, with the approach we’ll discuss in this talk, we are making significant progress using the latest machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. \n\nWord representations are a major component of many natural language processing (NLP) applications. \n\nIt is common to represent words as indices in a vocabulary, but this fails to capture the rich relational structure of the lexicon.\n\nVector-based models do much better in this regard. They encode continuous similarities between words as distance or angle between word vectors in a high-dimensional space.\n\nDeep learning has markedly improved speech recognition and image classification. Now we apply neural networks to understanding words by having them “read” vast quantities of text on the web resulting a vector-based model.\n\nThis approach has proven useful in tasks such as machine translation (Skype Translator, Google Translate), sentiment analysis, text categorization, word sense disambiguation, question answering (IBM Watson) and many others.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll present the algorithm and its magical characteristics, various possible NLP applications for this technology and I’ll demonstrate it in the context of product reviews.\n\nBottom line - if you eat text for lunch or you just want a glimpse into amazing world this one is definitely for you.\n\nLinks:\nhttps://medium.com/backchannel/google-search-will-be-your-next-brain-5207c26e4523\nhttps://code.google.com/p/word2vec/\n\n","comments":[],"createdAt":{"$date":"2015-01-20T09:21:48.373Z"},"editing":false,"speaker_ids":["6cWcQYcSb4WCTnigg"],"status":"maybe next time","tags":["NLP"],"title":"Learning the meaning behind words - Introduction to Google's Word2Vec algorithm","type":"full","votes":{"2obg4T5ZRqh67x3E3":true,"3iW2SGTxRsQikNX2k":true,"3pjrp7GMJynYQDNCE":true,"4kGbbk4vbpqsbsa37":true,"5fDzzMTGHvJtSboQ5":true,"CR6GeZYFLBgGos59M":true,"DYcB4zS5eFbiERNpM":true,"EpgBmBAwBxc25aAtD":true,"FFrAPCXzcn2Mim5cw":true,"FabtFadHpxtRy5vtD":true,"GvFexDAjQ6gWMfood":true,"HuePNBXRJQRtJGjGp":true,"JM7sj2GNStZB7MyaF":true,"JiPdYNqZGa733Rr2N":true,"KXmcAKYLSnP42Dmdu":true,"KiCTsHyAde7RwKz3c":true,"LvrRdBrrXfmieoBr9":true,"NcxCwFCiGd4cZBmaT":true,"PRsNftrr9Co3CxqGs":true,"Pv9ApaphhaLYrLcf8":true,"QBKEWD6F2Gce47LyC":true,"QQtw5evrJZQpFJ2z3":true,"RCjgZcWauHSkBJeH4":true,"W9v9xx9nCczfbRvDT":true,"crRFdAJgTvLrJvfJM":true,"e7RNvqj7mySarECJM":true,"hMRrmPzNfWq5W5JvL":true,"jAjsLmjpL4hHHTonu":true,"kFuxy5pzFT6nkvnCE":true,"kfrRdSSWNED5A6v98":true,"oHizgruYfc99yRbMr":true,"oSsEQA4gtXPmfaYz3":true,"oXjwMG88i5b4P96FE":true,"pqxRF6NRTjaKX43Q3":true,"r3bmKede3wdyJ2sHp":true,"sunFBnipvqSYPdfQc":true,"tFxbkfFpttSRGSZvJ":true,"ttYQXSzcNYT64WcKu":true,"vcLST4tkx3P7NTp4K":true,"vy6LDJTvgX25KMMLE":true}}

In this talk, we'll be discussing the following topics:\n- How to get ALL users to answer your emails\n- How to identify the critical moments when users are about to leave and bring them back\n- Which wording to use to get honest feedback\n- The important stats you're not using today\n- The one question that helped us understand our users' needs ","comments":[],"createdAt":{"$date":"2015-01-26T20:18:31.484Z"},"speaker_ids":["uNKDYrsY3MoTXShFF"],"status":"accepted","tags":["product"],"title":"The ugly truth: 11 ways to learn what users really think about your product ","type":"full","votes":{"2Wb7gzqAMgWCfLdkZ":true,"3fswLvgZogRs9Eozj":true,"484v4NMahoZKM3svx":true,"4X6rRBjJNLurHvmHb":true,"4kGbbk4vbpqsbsa37":true,"5X6WcGD5LNu4zEerR":true,"5fDzzMTGHvJtSboQ5":true,"6kz6d3SEJi463qinP":true,"CdkpvDREyXy4Lcyb4":true,"DLcPBxaG7dYY9oS9j":true,"DgQH9GtpkMxy2HCzu":true,"DhZneQiSkgqEYuhje":true,"E3D5QKPdAoZA4kP87":true,"EXv78X999JFxcuz6E":true,"Enx75Q77apCyGhw3m":true,"Fh2Rnf2uyPggcMzww":true,"GXzSSpwYzeDLSiXZS":true,"GvFexDAjQ6gWMfood":true,"HeLnxbGEbQ8TEEBSk":true,"JBXdp43eXCxFDBc4n":true,"JiPdYNqZGa733Rr2N":true,"N2dH8soZqrwG77sDg":true,"NcxCwFCiGd4cZBmaT":true,"Pe2Q4uwoCfzxhWrQN":true,"Pv9ApaphhaLYrLcf8":true,"QHuB4hGdpxkNZhiDY":true,"QN7jgbRjsnt8mrDFe":true,"RPGS3JPh6gdo8LbzP":true,"S7zuoJCJmDkafER4P":true,"SgCEz96uRKCdpBQFc":true,"TQhcyWo4BrZqqDC7E":true,"TWoTr999zqjWJzbn9":true,"WqL5Z6GXzDd55gPj9":true,"X3R2KQjyN4iZJLRag":true,"XXCmtNCN59T25ztZJ":true,"Xp85xJu8d6tFj9L6Y":true,"XyhkpzmKCwMaqucre":true,"Y7rAchhPL9rojsc9B":true,"YLprpX38TajD5C533":true,"ae3ozGfgBkGFWdaAZ":true,"bgY8ngzHKtLPMFJce":true,"bhkoaLQi6rLpsGXk7":true,"egLMkZQuoLdWN2GLX":true,"f7mGLxmjDmBdk7usx":true,"g5SrLMk424gb66Pwn":true,"hMRrmPzNfWq5W5JvL":true,"hyLZac4bCXshKCQym":true,"iPMcAJxciqjWWx8sB":true,"iPYvwW8oNxa9cynAv":true,"ita7F633uz8KpgeHo":true,"jAjsLmjpL4hHHTonu":true,"jZNaKhWhFyKJcxkXt":true,"k4BDubqG893JTNG3T":true,"kFuxy5pzFT6nkvnCE":true,"kcf5LKokNppz2uz3A":true,"kfrRdSSWNED5A6v98":true,"mrtBidzmWnb4oNhfu":true,"nL9ABmybTRBnBQW4Z":true,"oHizgruYfc99yRbMr":true,"oSB82M3Ta4P8vdHZb":true,"oaw7JYHdK7uTNbdKn":true,"omoWtADZQotZSGSzW":false,"pAko9rqMGQyDEkGrg":true,"pqxRF6NRTjaKX43Q3":true,"qetoANJsH46ozqzg8":true,"qpfsYsyGorYtMdvYd":true,"r4PcoZH3CE3avctSc":true,"rByf88iyr4sr8t2Gd":true,"syAkqnjCn2bx6DaX8":true,"tcyhLYPvdzC585aRz":true,"ttYQXSzcNYT64WcKu":true,"tzTYm3DCYEfYPxss7":true,"upwhrhYojA2xhsHJt":true,"vQe8pTQzcEW9bPgGw":true,"vf8eKeBCwpLxjig7i":true,"vy6LDJTvgX25KMMLE":true,"yFpccAWMFYREhdT9a":true}}

Accord's validation rules are trivially composable.\n* __Simple__: Accord provides a dead-simple story for validation rule definition by leveraging macros, as well as the validation call site (see example below).\n* __Self-contained__: Accord is macro-based but completely self-contained, and consequently only relies on the Scala runtime and reflection libraries.\n* __Integrated__: Other than providing its own DSL and matcher library, Accord is designed to easily integrate with other libraries, and provides out-of-the-box integration with [Spring Validation](https://github.com/wix/accord/wiki/Spring-Integration), [Specs2](https://github.com/wix/accord/wiki/Specs%C2%B2-Integration) and [ScalaTest](https://github.com/wix/accord/wiki/ScalaTest-Integration).\n\nAccord is developed and used at [Wix](http://www.wix.com) and distributed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), which basically means you can use and modify it freely.

And when it’s a developer product, it’s even more challenging because developers immediately calculate the product’s ROI before committing to using it. Easy onboarding, clear documentation, and helpful support forums are expected and critical. But to build a community around your developer product, you’ll have to do much more. Events, developer lounges, and social media campaigns are just some of the efforts Wix invests in its developer community. \n\nSince opening our  app market over two years ago, we’ve had several successes and we’ve made more than a few mistakes. As we expand our developer product offerings beyond the app market, we are fixing what went wrong while planning for the future. And we’d like to share what we’re learning with you. By supplying open source libraries, better documentation, and hosting tech events in our lounges, we’re creating a better overall developer experience while growing our community. \n","comments":[],"createdAt":{"$date":"2015-01-25T19:31:53.882Z"},"editing":false,"speaker_ids":["XyhkpzmKCwMaqucre"],"status":"maybe next time","tags":["case-study","community","open-source"],"title":"If You Build It, Will They Come?
